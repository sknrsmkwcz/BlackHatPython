# BlackHatPython

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I document my projects from the book "Black Hat Python, 2nd Edition" by Justin Seitz. This book delves into the world of cybersecurity and ethical hacking using Python, and I've been exploring its contents, creating projects, and learning along the way.

**Disclaimer**
I want to emphasize that the projects created from this book were for educational and ethical purposes only. Hacking or any malicious activity is illegal and unethical. Always respect the law and seek proper authorization when performing security-related tasks.
Feel free to explore these projects and learn from them. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
